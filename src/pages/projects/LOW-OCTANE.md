## Introduction
*LOW OCTANE* is my bubbling melting pot of inspiration taken from many of the shooters I have played in my lifetime, and has been my main project ever since starting on the *8th of August 2023*.

I am the sole **programmer** and **modeller** on this project, while also taking individual contributions in **animation/sound** design. I work with one other person who **animates** and handles **map design**.

### Description
The game is a **realistic first person shooter** that aims to truly simulate combat under **extreme conditions**. It features in-depth **weapon customisation** system and an **extensive health system**.

### Check it out!

You may see videos of the game on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fireys6200), or play it on **ROBLOX** [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/16030349851/LOW-OCTANE).
